Eurysta is _not_ ready for production code. It's getting there, but use caution!

TODO:

1. Error reporting
2. Usable post-parse object interface (essentially a few wrapper functions)
3. DOCUMENTATION and more insightful comments

If you spot an issue, egregious or slight, send a pull request!

Re: benchmarking:

More steps need to be taken to ensure code-correctness before optimization and
benchmarking are considered. Eurysta is by no means _slow_, but perhaps some
areas (such as memory allocation) have optimization potential. We'll see.

Peace & love,

Coleman
