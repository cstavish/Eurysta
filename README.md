# Eurysta
| *your-**wrist**-ah* | noun: **an exceedingly high-performance JSON toolkit written in C**

### Status
Eurysta is indeed young, and while work is ongoing, you can safely use it in a project. However, certain niceties (or necessities ; )) like solid documentation and an Objective-C wrapper are not ready at this time (although I hope to make them available soon).

### Contributions
Feedback, constructive criticism, and contributions of code, documentation, benchmark data, etc. are *most welcome* and greatly appreciated.
